                <p>The Shattered Vale unfurls like a fever dream gone feral—a vast, untamed jungle pulsing at the edge of reality. Towering ferns, their fronds jagged and faintly luminous, claw toward a sky split by veins of static, where clouds glitch into pixelated smears before snapping back into shape. The ground is a carpet of glowing moss, soft underfoot but alive, rippling with every step as if tasting the intruders’ presence. Twisted vines dangle from gnarled trees, their bark flickering with digital scars—code bleeding through the seams of this broken world. The air hums electric, thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth, pierced by distant screeches that echo too long, too wrong.</p>

                <p>The Crimson Tower pierces the Shattered Vale’s horizon—a jagged spire of twisted metal and stone, its surface pulsing with a deep, arterial red that flickers like a dying screen. Barbed tendrils of wire and vine coil up its sides, snapping with sparks where they meet, while cracked windows glow with a sickly amber light, casting long, distorted shadows across the jungle. The air around it crackles, heavy with static, and the ground at its base is scorched black, littered with glitched fragments that twitch and fade. At its peak, a massive, unblinking eye of red static stares down, unyielding and cold.</p>

                <p>Glitchwood sprawls as a shadowy tangle of gnarled trees, their branches twisted into jagged spirals that flicker in and out of sight. A thick, gray fog clings to the ground, swirling with faint, pixelated wisps that pulse like trapped breaths. The bark glimmers with a dull, metallic sheen, streaked with veins of green static that hum faintly, while brittle leaves crunch underfoot, dissolving into ash with each step. The air hangs heavy, tinged with a sharp, metallic tang, and a distant, warped melody drifts through the silence, sourceless and unending.</p>

                <p>Oakhaven High hulks on the town’s edge, a squat fortress of faded red brick streaked with ivy and scratched graffiti. Narrow windows gleam dully under a flat gray sky, their grime-streaked panes flickering with the buzz of fluorescent lights. The asphalt lot cracks and crumbles, strewn with cigarette butts and rusting bike frames, while a chipped sign—“Home of the Timberwolves”—leans forward, its mascot’s snarl worn to a ghostly outline. Inside, scuffed linoleum stretches past dented lockers plastered with peeling band stickers, the air thick with chalk dust and the faint hum of flickering halls.</p>
