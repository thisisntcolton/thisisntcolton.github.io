            <h2>Session 1: Detention to Disaster</h2>

                <p>Elysium. The name itself hums with a power we barely grasp, a whisper of something ancient and vast. Like stumbling into the Forbidden Forest, only… bigger. And realer.</p>
                <p>Saturday, March 27th, 1990. Another sunrise, another reason Oakhaven High wanted my head on a platter. This time? Smokes behind the girls' locker room. Classic Crash. My skateboard, my ticket out, but they always catch up. Detention. A sentence in the grey-walled library, a holding cell for the school’s unwanted.</p>
                <p>My room? A rebellion shrine. Faded Cure and Stones posters, a lava lamp's sickly glow, a graveyard of mixtapes and half-dead markers. The scent of stale smoke and cheap hairspray, a metallic tang that clung like a curse. My skateboard, chipped and scarred, leaned against the wall—proof that gravity and I had a complicated relationship.</p>
                <p>I was sprawled on my bed, a tangled mess of black hair and green eyes shadowed by last night’s eyeliner. ‘Just Like Heaven’ bled from my Walkman, a soundtrack to my escape plans. My fingers, stained with ink and nicotine, traced jagged lines in a notebook filled with dark poetry and darker schemes.</p>
                <p>Outside, the house vibrated with Robbie’s chaos. Twenty, buzzcut, smelling of grease and burnt toast. Mom’s note on the fridge: ‘Don’t burn the place down.’ Yeah, right. He thought he was in charge. A laugh escaped me as I dodged a flying sock. ‘School drop-off, loser!’ I yelled, snagging his cigarettes. ‘Not my problem you got detention, Crash. What’d you do, hotwire the principal’s golf cart?’ He groaned. I blew smoke in his face, a silent ‘screw you,’ and grabbed my board.</p>
                <p>The Camaro, a metal beast coughing exhaust, rumbled down the street. Inside, stale fast food and motor oil. Robbie griped, I blew smoke rings out the window. Top 40 drivel—Wilson Phillips—got replaced by the static hiss of a forgotten tape. We screeched to a halt at Oakhaven, its grey walls looming like a fortress under a stormy sky. ‘Don’t call me to bail you out!’ he growled, a flicker of something like pride in his eyes. I flipped my hair, skateboard tucked under my arm, and strode towards the entrance. Every step, a declaration of war. Detention was just another arena, and I was ready to play.</p>
                <p>Inside, the library was a weird menagerie. Not the usual detention crowd. The concert in the next town had thinned the ranks, leaving behind a strange cast of characters.</p>
                <p>Tank Russo, the Jock. Letterman jacket, guttural growls, and the kind of arrogance that could choke a dragon. He strutted in, a walking monument to misplaced testosterone.</p>
                <p>Owen Scott, Tank’s shadow. A mystery. They were brothers in everything but blood, a bond forged in some forgotten playground. Tank, the golden boy, always protected Owen, a silent promise etched in their shared history.</p>
                <p>Lauren ‘LuLu’ Sinclair, the Preppy Princess. Perfect hair, perfect smirk, flipping through a magazine like it held the secrets of the universe. We’d exchanged maybe two words in three years.</p>
                <p>Nicol Petrov. He was the anomaly. Quiet, watchful. I caught the Motorhead on his Walkman. A flicker of something in those dark eyes, a spark of rebellion that mirrored my own. Maybe, just maybe, he wasn’t a total waste of space.</p>
                <p>And then there was Joey Cunningham. Bible-thumping, country-boy Joey. What had he done to end up here? A puzzle wrapped in denim and scripture. He sat there, a stark contrast to the rest of us, a sheep among wolves.</p>
                <p>“The library doors groaned open, a rusty maw swallowing us whole, and in stalked Mr. Vernon Hargrove, Oakhaven's personal Dementor. A wiry, late-forties scarecrow, his thinning brown hair slicked back with enough Brylcreem to drown a small rodent, gleaming like oil-slicked asphalt under the flickering fluorescent lights. His tie, a mustard-yellow abomination from the 70s, hung crooked over a rumpled shirt, and his slacks whispered of a thousand detentions past. He reeked of stale coffee and Old Spice, a miasma of despair.</p>
                <p>He slapped a stack of detention slips onto the table, the sound echoing like a death knell. ‘You think you’re clever, delinquents?’ His voice, gravel rasping against gravel, cut through the silence. ‘Stack those books, shut your traps, and maybe—just maybe—you’ll learn something.’ He peered over his wire-rimmed glasses, a hawk eyeing its prey, then shuffled towards the door, muttering about ‘needing a smoke.’ Like we were keeping him from his precious vices.</p>
                <p>‘I don’t want to be here any more than you low-life scum do,’ he rasped, turning back at the door. ‘Your assignment: a thousand-word essay on who you think you are and how that delusion landed you in Saturday school. Ruining my weekend plans, I might add.’ He paused, a dark threat hanging in the air. ‘I’ll be back at lunch. Stay out of trouble, or you’ll be wishing you’d never been born.’ The door slammed shut, and the library became a pressure cooker.</p>
                <p>I knew the drill. Always did. And this morning, I’d ‘borrowed’ Robbie’s stash. A little green escape from this grey hell. I reached into my baggie flannel, pulling out the contraband. ‘Anyone up for a little library session?’</p>
                <p>‘WOOOOAH NOW!’ Joey, the resident saint, practically vibrated with righteous indignation. ‘I don’t think we need the Devil’s Lettuce in here!’ Everyone else let out a collective sigh, the sound of a thousand souls trapped in purgatory.</p>
                <p>At least they weren’t all buying his act. Nicol and Owen were the first to step up, a silent agreement passing between them. Lulu and Tank, meanwhile, were lost in their own little bubble of vapid chatter, oblivious to the brewing rebellion. They were the Capitol citizens, happy to ignore the suffering around them.</p>
                <p>The scent of weed, sharp and rebellious, began to fill the air, a middle finger to Hargrove and his rules. In this grey tomb, a spark of defiance flickered, a promise that even in detention, we wouldn’t be broken.”</p>
                <p>“While Nikoli was blasting off to another planet, I found myself sitting with him and Owen. These guys weren't so bad after all. I hadn't expected Owen to partake. Maybe he wasn't as closed off and introverted as I thought. Perhaps he was just shy, waiting for an opening. Either way, I wasn't sure.</p>
                <p>I could just barely make out a conversation behind us. Tank and Lulu seemed to be deep in discussion. I hadn't realized they were that close.</p>
                <p>Lulu: "You okay, Tommy? You seem… off."</p>
                <p>Tank: (Forces a grin that doesn't quite reach his eyes) "Yeah, just… family stuff. Nothing you'd want to hear about."</p>
                <p>Lulu: (A touch of sincerity in her voice) "Hey, if you need to talk…"</p>
                <p>Tank: (Nods, a quiet "Thanks.")</p>
                <p>Lulu, sensing his discomfort, expertly changed the subject.</p>
                <p>Lulu: "Hey, remember that time in freshman year, when we tried to sneak into the movie theater?"</p>
                <p>Tank: (Chuckles, a hint of awkwardness) "And I tripped over the trashcan, and we got caught. Yeah, I remember."</p>
                <p>Lulu: "We were so stupid." She said, a smile playing on her lips.</p>
                <p>Tank: "Yeah, but it was fun." (He paused, a flicker of something in his eyes.) "Life was… simpler then."</p>
                <p>I realized I was eavesdropping, which was probably a low even for me, and redirected my attention back to Owen and Nikoli.”</p>
